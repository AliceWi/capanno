  samtools calmd [-Eeubr] [-C capQcoef] aln.bam ref.fasta

  Generate the MD tag. If the MD tag is already present, this command will give a warning if the MD tag generated is different from the existing tag.
  Output SAM by default.

  Calmd can also read and write CRAM files although in most cases it is pointless as CRAM recalculates MD and NM tags on the fly.
  The one exception to this case is where both input and output CRAM files have been / are being created with the no_ref option.
