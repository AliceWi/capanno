  samtools depad [-SsCu1] [-T ref.fa] [-o output] in.bam

  Converts a BAM aligned against a padded reference to a BAM aligned against the depadded reference.
  The padded reference may contain verbatim "*" bases in it, but "*" bases are also counted in the reference numbering.
  This means that a sequence base-call aligned against a reference "*" is considered to be a cigar match ("M" or "X") operator (if the base-call is "A", "C", "G" or "T").
  After depadding the reference "*" bases are deleted and such aligned sequence base-calls become insertions. Similarly transformations apply for deletions and padding cigar operations.
