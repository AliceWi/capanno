  samtools reheader [-iP] in.header.sam in.bam

  Replace the header in in.bam with the header in in.header.sam.
  This command is much faster than replacing the header with a BAM→SAM→BAM conversion.

  By default this command outputs the BAM or CRAM file to standard output (stdout), but for CRAM format files it has the option to perform an in-place edit, both reading and writing to the same file.
  No validity checking is performed on the header, nor that it is suitable to use with the sequence data itself.
