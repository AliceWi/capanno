  Replace read groups in a BAM file.
  This tool enables the user to replace all read groups in the INPUT file with a single new read group and assign all reads to this read group in the OUTPUT BAM file.

  For more information about read groups, see the GATK Dictionary entry.

  This tool accepts INPUT BAM and SAM files or URLs from the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) (see http://ga4gh.org/#/documentation).
