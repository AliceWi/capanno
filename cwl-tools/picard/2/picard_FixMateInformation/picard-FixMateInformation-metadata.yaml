  Verify mate-pair information between mates and fix if needed.
  This tool ensures that all mate-pair information is in sync between each read and its mate pair.
  If no OUTPUT file is supplied then the output is written to a temporary file and then copied over the INPUT file.
  Reads marked with the secondary alignment flag are written to the output file unchanged.
