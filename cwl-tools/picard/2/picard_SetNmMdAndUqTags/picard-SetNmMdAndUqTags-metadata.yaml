  Fixes the NM, MD, and UQ tags in a SAM file.
  This tool takes in a SAM or BAM file (sorted by coordinate) and calculates the NM, MD, and UQ tags by comparing with the reference.
  This may be needed when MergeBamAlignment was run with SORT_ORDER different from 'coordinate' and thus could not fix these tags then.
