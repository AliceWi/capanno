  Collect metrics about coverage and performance of whole genome sequencing (WGS) experiments.

  This tool collects metrics about the fractions of reads that pass base- and mapping-quality filters as well as coverage (read-depth) levels for WGS analyses.
  Both minimum base- and mapping-quality values as well as the maximum read depths (coverage cap) are user defined.

  Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!
