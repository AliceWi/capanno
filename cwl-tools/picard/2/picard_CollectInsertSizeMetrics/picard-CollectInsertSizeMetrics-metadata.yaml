description: >-
  This tool provides useful metrics for validating library construction including the insert size distribution and read orientation of paired-end libraries.

  The expected proportions of these metrics vary depending on the type of library preparation used, resulting from technical differences between pair-end libraries and mate-pair libraries.
  For a brief primer on paired-end sequencing and mate-pair reads, see the GATK Dictionary.
  The CollectInsertSizeMetrics tool outputs the percentages of read pairs in each of the three orientations (FR, RF, and TANDEM) as a histogram.
  In addition, the insert size distribution is output as both a histogram (.insert_size_Histogram.pdf) and as a data table (.insert_size_metrics.txt).

  Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!
