description: >-
  Merges multiple SAM and/or BAM files into a single file.
  This tool is used for combining SAM and/or BAM files from different runs or read groups, similarly to the "merge" function of Samtools (http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html).

  Note that to prevent errors in downstream processing, it is critical to identify/label read groups appropriately.
  If different samples contain identical read group IDs, this tool will avoid collisions by modifying the read group IDs to be unique.
  For more information about read groups, see the GATK Dictionary entry.
