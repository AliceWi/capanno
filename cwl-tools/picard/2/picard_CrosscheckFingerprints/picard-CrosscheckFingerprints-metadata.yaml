description: >-
  Checks if all fingerprints within a set of files appear to come from the same individual.
  The fingerprints are calculated initially at the readgroup level (if present) but can be "rolled-up" by library, sample or file, to increase power and provide results at the desired resolution.
  Regular output is in a "Moltenized" format, one row per comparison.
  In this format the output will include the LOD score and also tumor-aware LOD score which can help assess identity even in the presence of a severe LOH sample with high purity.
  A matrix output is also available to facilitate visual inspection of crosscheck results.
  A separate CLP, ClusterCrosscheckMetrics, can cluster the results as a connected graph according to LOD greater than a threshold.
