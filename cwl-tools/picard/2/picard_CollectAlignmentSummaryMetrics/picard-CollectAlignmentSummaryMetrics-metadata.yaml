description: |
  Produces a summary of alignment metrics from a SAM or BAM file.
  This tool takes a SAM/BAM file input and produces metrics detailing the quality of the read alignments as well as the proportion of the reads that passed machine signal-to-noise threshold quality filters.
  Note that these quality filters are specific to Illumina data; for additional information, please see the corresponding GATK Dictionary entry.

  Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!
