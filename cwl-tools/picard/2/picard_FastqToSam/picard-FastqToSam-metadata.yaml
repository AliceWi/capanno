  Converts a FASTQ file to an unaligned BAM or SAM file.
  This tool extracts read sequences and base qualities from the input FASTQ file and writes them out to a new file in unaligned BAM (uBAM) format.
  Read group information can be provided on the command line.

  Three versions of FASTQ quality scales are supported: FastqSanger, FastqSolexa and FastqIllumina (see http://maq.sourceforge.net/fastq.shtml for details).
  Input FASTQ files can be in GZip format (with .gz extension).
