   tar - an archiving utility

  GNU  tar  is  an  archiving  program designed to store multiple files in a single file (an archive), and to manipulate such archives.
  The archive can be either a regular file or a device (e.g. a tape drive, hence the name of the program, which stands for tape archiver), which can be located either on the local or on a remote machine.
