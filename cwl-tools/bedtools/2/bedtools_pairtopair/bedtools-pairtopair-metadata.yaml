  pairToPair compares two BEDPE files in search of overlaps where each end of a BEDPE feature in A overlaps with the ends of a feature in B.
  For example, using pairToPair, one could screen for the exact same discordant paired-end alignment in two files.
  This could suggest (among other things) that the discordant pair suggests the same structural variation in each file/sample.
