description: >-
  Similar to merge, cluster report each set of overlapping or “book-ended” features in an interval file. In contrast to merge, cluster does not flatten the cluster of intervals into a new meta-interval; instead, it assigns an unique cluster ID to each record in each cluster.
  This is useful for having fine control over how sets of overlapping intervals in a single interval file are combined.
