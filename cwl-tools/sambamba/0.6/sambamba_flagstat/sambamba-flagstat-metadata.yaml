  Outputs some statistics drawn from read flags.

  First line contains numbers of QC-passed and QC-failed reads. Then come pairs of numbers, the former for QC-passed reads, the latter for QC-failed ones:

  duplicates
  mapped reads (plus percentage relative to the numbers from the first line)
  reads with 'is_paired' flag set
  paired reads which are first mates
  paired reads which are second mates
  paired reads with 'proper_pair' flag set (plus percentage relative to the numbers of QC-passed/failed reads with 'is_paired' flag set)
  paired reads where both mates are mapped
  paired reads where read itself is unmapped but mate is mapped
  paired reads where mate is mapped to a different chromosome
  the same as previous but mapping quality is not less than 5
