Description of the tool. Should be taken directly from the tool documentation if it exists.

ex:

~~~yaml
description: |
   grep  searches  for  PATTERN  in  each  FILE.  A FILE of “-” stands for standard input.  If no FILE is given, 
   recursive searches examine the working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.  By default, 
   grep prints the matching lines.

   In addition, the variant programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep are the same as grep -E, grep -F, and grep -r, respectively.  
   These variants are deprecated, but are provided for backward compatibility.
